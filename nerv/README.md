## About NERV Stack

The **NERV Stack** is a robust and efficient boilerplate designed for building modern, scalable web applications with a focus on speed and serverless deployment. It combines popular and powerful technologies to provide a seamless development experience from frontend to backend.

**Purpose:**
NERV Stack is engineered for:
* **Rapid Development:** Get your fullstack application up and running quickly with pre-configured tools.
* **Fullstack Capabilities:** Seamlessly integrate your React frontend with an Express.js backend.
* **Serverless Readiness:** Optimized for deployment on serverless platforms, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.
* **Sleek Design:** A minimalist, dark-mode aesthetic inspired by modern interfaces like Supabase.

## Technologies Used

* **Vite:** A lightning-fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
* **Express.js:** A flexible and minimalist Node.js web application framework, ideal for creating robust APIs.
* **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side execution.
* **Plain CSS:** Styled with a clean, custom minimalist dark theme, avoiding heavy CSS frameworks for leaner builds.
